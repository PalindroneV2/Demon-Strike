version "3.2.0"
// Everything below this line, including the files included, come from m8f's
// fantastic idclev-starter-0.5.1.pk3 mod. As per the license terms, the original
// license has also been included below the only changes that I (tango) made
// were to trim down the code to ONLY include the pistol start option, and add
// a "t_" prefix to everything to prevent naming conflicts if the original
// idclev-starter mod is loaded in addition.
